<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I'm a research associate doing a Ph.D. in the [Explainable AI (XAI)](https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/departments/ai/research-groups/explainable-artificial-intelligence.html) group at Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, and am fortunate to be advised by [Wojciech Samek](https://iphome.hhi.de/samek/) and [Sebastian Lapuschkin](https://iphome.hhi.de/lapuschkin/). Most of the time, I work at the intersection between machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). My research interests include analysis and interpretability for NLP, natural language understanding, and incremental (natural language) processing. 

I received my M.Sc. in Cognitive Systems from [University of Potsdam](https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/cogsys/index.html), where I was (and still is) advised by [David Schlangen](https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~das/). Before that, I did my undergraduate at [Swiss German University](https://sgu.ac.id/) and [South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences](https://www.fh-swf.de/de/) as a part of a double-degree program.
